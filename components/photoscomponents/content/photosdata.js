Streetlights flickered as the suns first rays painted the buildings in gold, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from a nearby café.

Somewhere, a newspaper vendor arranged his stack, glancing at headlines that would soon be devoured by busy commuters. It was a fleeting moment of stillness before the day unfolded in its usual chaos."
